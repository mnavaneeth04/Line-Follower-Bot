# 🤖Line Follower Robot

This repository contains the code and circuit setup for a simple **line follower robot** using an **Arduino Uno**, **IR sensors**, and an **L293D motor driver**. The robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface by constantly reading input from two IR sensors and adjusting its motors accordingly.

---

## 📝 Description

The project uses two IR sensors to detect the color contrast between a black line and a white surface. Based on the sensor readings, the Arduino controls two DC motors via an **L293D motor driver** to follow the path.

### Working Logic:
- **Both sensors on white** → Move **forward**
- **Right sensor on black** → **Turn right**
- **Left sensor on black** → **Turn left**
- **Both sensors on black** → **Stop** (e.g., end of path or intersection)

The robot is coded using the **Arduino programming language (C/C++)** and is compatible with the **Arduino IDE**.
